## Hi there 👋

### ✨ My name is <em><strong>Nitin Sawant</strong></em>. I am a web developer.

🌱 I'm currently working `with startups, SME businesses and entrepreneurs build their own apps. I am professional and handle everything from 'spec-out' the app to performing the QA, and making sure that it's launched and hosted on a website. I am totally communicative and I have references available upon request`.

🔭 I'm currently learning `IoT-Electronics, Arduino and .NET MAUI`.

📫 Ask me about `how to contact yourself in the future😜. [Send](mailto:nitin@nitinsawant.com) me an email or connect on [Skype](https://join.skype.com/vf00tYHEXShb) to schedule a consultation`.

😄 Fun fact: `To see the world, things dangerous to come to, to see behind walls, to draw closer, to find each other and feel. That is the Purpose of LIFE`.
